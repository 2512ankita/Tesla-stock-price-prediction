# Tesla-stock-price-prediction
**Overview**
This Jupyter Notebook contains an analysis and prediction of Tesla's stock prices using historical data. The project involves data exploration, visualization, and the application of machine learning models to predict future stock prices.

**Features**
Data Loading and Exploration: The notebook loads Tesla's historical stock price data from a CSV file and performs initial exploration to understand the dataset's structure.

Data Visualization: Uses libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize stock price trends over time.

Machine Learning Models: Implements several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVC), and XGBoost, to predict stock price movements.

Data Preprocessing: Includes steps like data splitting and standardization to prepare the data for modeling.

Model Evaluation: Utilizes metrics from sklearn.metrics to evaluate the performance of the predictive models.

**Requirements**
To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost


**Dataset**
